# Case-study--Cyclistic-Bike-Share-company-Fictional-

The bike-share company Cyclistic, in Chicago wants to analyze how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently as they want to design a strategy to maximise the number of annual memberships.
As a part of this project, analyzing historical data, I want to answer the questions, whether there is or no difference between casual riders and anuual members in the way they use the cyclistic bikes.
